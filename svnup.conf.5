.Sh NAME
.Nm svnup.conf
.Nd Configuration file for svnup(1).
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file stores configuration options and controls the behavior of svnup(1).  This file contains an arbitrary number of sections, each enclosed in square brackets, any of which can be passed as the first command line argument to svnup(1).  Options are placed one on each line, followed directly by an equals sign '=' and the value the option should be assigned.  Lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.  Additional, user defined sections can be added to
.Nm
as needed.
.Pp
When svnup(1) is run, the options in the [defaults] section are assigned first, followed by the options in the desired section (each of which will supersede any previously assigned default values), followed lastly by any command line options.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are currently supported by 
.Nm
and can be added to any section:
.Bl -tag -width "extra-files"
.It Cm host
The hostname/IP address of the Apache Subversion server.
.It Cm port
The custom port on the server to connect to.
.It Cm protocol
The protocol to use (currently supported protocols are 'http', 'https' or 'svn').
.It Cm branch
The repository branch to checkout.
.It Cm target
The local directory to store your copy of the repository.
.It Cm trim_tree
Controls what happens to any local files that do not appear in the repository.  1 = Remove all local files not found in the remote repository, 0 = leave local files alone.
.It Cm extra_files
Controls whether any local files that do not exist in the repository are displayed.  1 = Display all local files not found in the remote repository, 0 = do not display them.
.It Cm verbosity
How much of the transfer details to display.  0 = no output, 1 = show only names of the updated files/folders, 2 = also show a progress indicator, 3 = also show commands sent to the server and svn response codes (useful when debugging).

.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
With the following configuration options defined in
.Nm
.Pp
[defaults]
.br
host=svn0.us-west.freebsd.org
.br
protocol=https
.br
verbosity=1
.br
work_directory=/var/tmp/svnup
.Pp
[ports]
.br
protocol=svn
.br
branch=ports/head
.br
target=/usr/ports
.br
Executing:
.Pp
.Dl "svnup ports"
.Pp
from the command line would result in a copy of the ports/head branch downloaded to /usr/ports via the svn:// protocol (as the protocol and target values override those previously set in the [defaults] section).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/usr/local/etc/svnup.conf"
.It /usr/local/etc/svnup.conf
Default location of the
.El
.Nm
configuration file.
